Recent versions of VSCode have a lot of AI features baked in. Honestly, I don't want any AI features in my editor. I personally don't use much AI for coding, If I want to research or generate any small component or function, I use the browser version. This gives me further control in the code I produce.

Up until recently, we had to manually hide the icons or functions related to AI individually and it was a mess.

But now with the release of [1.104](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/release-notes/v1_104.md#hide-and-disable-github-copilot-ai-features), you can disable all the AI features at once by enabling the `chat.disableAIFeatures` setting.
